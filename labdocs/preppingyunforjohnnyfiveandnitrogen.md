# Prepping the Yun for Johnny-Five and Nitrogen

## Open the Instruction to Configure Wi-Fi on the Yun  
You don't need to complete the steps yet, but you will save yourself a headache by opening [these](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun#toc13) instructions up and having them ready.  

## Upgrade to Latest Version of OpenWRT  
When you first power on the Yún, it will create a WiFi network called ArduinoYun-XXXXXXXXXXXX. Connect your computer to this network.  
  
Follow the instructions [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/YunSysupgrade) to upgrade to the latest version of OpenWRT (the Linux distribution running on the Atheros processor).  

## Now Configure Wi-Fi on the Yun  
The following steps require the Arduino to have internet access. Follow the instructions [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun#toc13) to get the Arduino connected to your Wi-Fi.

## Expand Onto the microSD Card  
Follow the instructions [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ExpandingYunDiskSpace) to expand the Arduino disk spce onto the microSD card (we need the space because the Arduino has only a small amount of flash storage).  
>When prompted for the expansion size enter **4096**  

## Add a Swap File  
Using the Serial Monitor or SSH (e.g. PuTTY, Terminal, etc.), enter the following:  

    dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile count=512 bs=1M  
    mkswap /swapfile
    swapon /swapfile

Using SSH (e.g. PuTTY, Terminal, etc.), edit fstab with vi  

    vi /etc/config/fstab  

Append the following to the file and use the :wq vi command to save and exit the file  

    config swap  
                option device    /swapfile  

Enable the swap file  

    /etc/init.d/fstab enable

## Install the BINUTILS Package

    opkg update
    opkg install binutils

## Get YUN-GCC and Force Install It to root  

    wget  http://downloads.arduino.cc/openwrtyun/1/packages/yun-gcc_4.6.2-2_ar71xx.ipk
    
The following step can take from 5 to 20 minutes.  

    opkg install --force-overwrite yun-gcc_4.6.2-2_ar71xx.ipk
    opkg update

>vi sometimes generates xterm errors; if it does, do the following:  

    opkg install vim

## Install Node  

    opkg install node

[Node.js Reference](http://blog.arduino.cc/2014/05/06/time-to-expand-your-yun-disk-space-and-install-node-js/)
## Serialport/Johnny-Five/Firmata Update  

    opkg install node-serialport

The following step can take several minutes.  

    npm install –g johnny-five

## Disable the Bridge Script  
Remove the bridge setup from the inittab script by commenting out the **ttyATH0** line using the stream editor. This will replace the first argumenet (ttyAHT0) with the second argument (# ttyAHT0) which results in the line being commented out.  

    sed -i -e 's/ttyATH0/# ttyATH0/g' /etc/inittab
  
## Install Nitrogen.js  

    npm install –g nitrogen
    npm install –g nitrogen-cli

## Install the AllJoyn Samples  

    opkg install alljoyn-samples alljoyn-sample_apps
    
Congratulations! Your Arduino Yun is configured and ready for you to [deploy Nitrogen apps to it](./deploytoyun.md ).
